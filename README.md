# RAWSurf

This is the code for [3-D Measurement and Reconstruction of Space
Target Based on RAW Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900536).

We integrated our RAWSurf framework on [NeuS](https://github.com/Totoro97/NeuS),
[VDN-NeRF](https://github.com/BoifZ/VDN-NeRF), and 
[NeUDF](https://github.com/IGLICT/NeUDF) and formed 
*RAW-NeuS*,*RAW-VDN* and *RAW-UDF*. We have only made the necessary changes 
and the usage methods are consistent with the previous ones.
